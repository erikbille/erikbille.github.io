    Hosting and maintenance of two websites
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    When my dad started his own business, I had the opportunity to help him set up web hosting and email.
    Rather than going straight to Squarespace or similar vendors, I decided to set it up myself and learn some things along the way.
    I'm now maintaining a <mark>Ubuntu</mark> hosted <mark>LAMP-stack</mark> based WordPress installation, routing traffic to it via <mark>Cloudflare</mark>, striving to make it as secure and fast as possible.
