    My role at Kullander has evolved over the years, starting with providing support and education to home users and growing into working exclusively with our corporate customers.

    Initially, I worked full time for two years in Sweden in the office and on-site at our clients. I later had the opportunity to scale my role down to a part-time commitment alongside university, exclusively working remotely.

    In my current role, I provide second and third line support to corporate end-users, help automate our business procedures and systems with APIs and <mark>Python</mark> scripting, support colleagues in developing our services offering and help manage our internal systems.
    I've got experience in setting up and working with <mark>Office 365</mark>, <mark>VMware ESXi</mark>, <mark>Freenas and Truenas</mark>, <mark>Jamf Pro</mark>, <mark>Cisco Meraki</mark> and <mark>Code42 Crashplan</mark>, among other things.
    As my university course is heavily focuced on <mark>networking</mark>, I also aid in designing and supporting our network deployments at clients offices.
